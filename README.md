While it can corrupt various types of files, including BIOS files for video game emulators (e.g., PlayStation BIN files), **extreme caution is advised when working with BIOS files.** Corrupting these files may result in flashing lights (e.g., rapid color changes or flickering) and/or loud, disturbing audio (e.g., buzzing, screeching, or ringing).
